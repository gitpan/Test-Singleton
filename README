       This is asimple, basic module for checking whether a class is a Single-
       ton. A Singleton describes an object class that can have only one
       instance in any system.  An example of a Singleton might be a print
       spooler or system registry, or any kind of central dispatcher.

       For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see "Design
       Patterns", Gamma et al, Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63361-2.
