=head1 NAME

Test::Singleton - Test for Singleton classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More tests => 1;
    use Test::Singleton;
    is_singleton( "Some::Class", "new", "instance" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

** If you are unfamiliar with testing B<read Test::Tutorial> first! **

This is asimple, basic module for checking whether a class is a
Singleton. A Singleton describes an object class that can have only
one instance in any system.  An example of a Singleton might be a
print spooler or system registry, or any kind of central dispatcher.

For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see 
"Design Patterns", Gamma et al, Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63361-2.
